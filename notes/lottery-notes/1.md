## Global Variable

The `msg` is a global variable that is available for the entirity of the contract and all it's methods. We can get the address of anyone making or changing the contract from here

### Array behaviour

**Fixed and dynamic available**

When calling an Array, we don't get the whole variable back, instead we're asked to provide an index for the array item that we're requesting.

To get all the numbers in an array, we need to write a function that does just that, returns the final array. The self generated getter, doesn't do this by default.

By default `strings` are saved as arrays of strings. **"YET"**, could be different.

### Mapping & Structs

Mappings and structs look just like javascript objects, but with mapping, the keys have to be the same and the values have to be the same (type). Structs can have mixed types.

Mapping for many things, Struct for single type of thing with varied values.

### Function Types

### Sudo Random Numbers

**Gaming the contract**

We don't have the ability to create a random number, so we have to fake it. This means that the contract can be gamed...

All of these things can be known ahead of time so someone can game the contract, there shouldn't be any element of randomness within the contract in order to avoid this.
